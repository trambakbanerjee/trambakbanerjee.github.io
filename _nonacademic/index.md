## Books

Outside of research, I enjoy reading fiction / non-fiction that are deliberately orthogonal to my academic work. Here is <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8136759-trambak" target="_blank"> my Goodreads profile</a>  and here are two books I am currently reading.

<div class="books-container">

  <div class="book-item">
    <p class="book-title"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18143977" target="_blank">All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr</a></p>
    <p class="book-text">
      A beautifully written novel about war, memory, and human resilience,
      with a remarkable attention to quiet, human details.

  <div class="book-item">
   <p class="book-title"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10357575" target="_blank">1Q84, Book 2 by Haruki Murakami</a></p>
    <p class="book-text">
      A slow and immersive continuation of Murakami’s parallel world,
      where ambiguity deepens rather than resolves.
