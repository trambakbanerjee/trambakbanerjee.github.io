   <li><a href= "https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fusionclust" target="_blank">fusionclust</a> - An R package for clustering and feature screening in large scale problems. In particular, fusionclust provides the <a href= "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rssb.12226/abstract" target="_blank">Big Merge Tracker (BMT)</a> and <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047259X17300271" target="_blank">COSCI</a> algorithms for convex clustering and feature screening using an ?1 fusion penalty.<br/>

     <li><a href= "https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=truh" target="_blank">truh</a> - An R package that implements the TRUH test statistic for nonparametric two sample testing under heterogeneity. TRUH incorporates the underlying heterogeneity and imbalance in the samples, and provides a conservative test for the composite null hypothesis that the two samples arise from the same mixture distribution but may differ with respect to the mixing weights. See <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-statistics/volume-14/issue-4/A-nearest-neighbor-based-nonparametric-test-for-viral-remodeling-in/10.1214/20-AOAS1362.short" target="_blank">Trambak Banerjee, Bhaswar B. Bhattacharya, Gourab Mukherjee Ann. Appl. Stat. 14(4): 1777-1805 (December 2020)</a> for more details.<br/>
