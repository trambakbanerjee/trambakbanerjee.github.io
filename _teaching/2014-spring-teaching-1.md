      <h4>BSAN 730: Large Scale Data Analysis (graduate) - Spring 2021 - 2023</h4>
        <p>In this course I focus on the statistical analysis of large-scale data. Students learn how some well-known statistical tools can be adapted for the analysis of Big Data and how the limitations of classical tools have engineered the development of modern techniques for data analysis. This course relies heavily on computer programming using R and the emphasis is on applications. Special thanks to the guest speakers ([Weinan Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wangweinan), [Aniruddha Neogi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aniruddha-neogi-a692912), [Joshua Derenski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-derenski10031993), and [Bradley Rava](https://bradleyrava.github.io//)) who have given a lecture in this class and have shared their unique experiences in managing and analyzing large data.</p>
