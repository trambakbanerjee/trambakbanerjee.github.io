I am an Assistant Professor - [Business Analytics](https://business.ku.edu/people/academic-areas/analytics-information-systems-and-operations/business-analytics){: target="_blank"} at the [University of Kansas School of Business](https://business.ku.edu/){: target="_blank"}. I completed my PhD in Business Administration ([Statistics](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/StatGroup/){: target="_blank"}) from the [Marshall School of Business](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/){: target="_blank"} at the University of Southern California. My research involves the development of rigorous statistical methods for analyzing modern high dimensional data when issues such as unobserved heterogeneity and noise accumulation in these datasets impede inferences using standard methods. The following are my current research interests: 

1. Shrinkage Estimation and Empirical Bayes Prediction,
2. High Dimensional Penalized Likelihood Methods, and
3. Big Data applications in Health, Consumer Behavior and Marketing.

I am interested in forging new collaborations at KU and exploring research ideas that have a common interest.

The RA will be responsible for developing several <b>R</b> packages and eventually publishing them on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). Publications in peer reviewed statistical software journals, such as the [JSS](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index), are a possibility too. The ideal candidate will be comfortable with <b>R</b> and shall have atleast some experience in using the <b>Rcpp</b> package. If you are interested and are excited about learning several modern Statistical techniques for data analysis through this experience, then feel free to drop me a line. </em>
